Blasts in the blood are associated with cancers such as myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myelogenous leukemia.

The features of
leukocytes by Vogado [22] simultaneously achieved using
CaﬀeNet, AlexNet, and Vgg-f architectures, which, at that
time, were among the most eﬃcient CNN [22]

Other ML algorithms such
as SVM, ANN, and decision tree have been used fre-
quently to segment blast in blood smear images.

What are blasts? Blasts are precursors to the mature, circulating blood cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and erythrocytes. Blasts are usually found in low numbers in the bone marrow. They are not usually found in significant numbers in the blood.
